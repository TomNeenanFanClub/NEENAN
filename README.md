Project goals:
==============================

1. Read music files and play them.

2. Better classification systems for classical music: I.E. composer, performers, historical period, idk.

3. Connect to IMSLP and retrieve sheet music for the piece being played if possible. Will need for the user to agree to the snippet that IMSLP always presents.

4. Can we figure out a way to automatically retrieve historical background for the listener? One easy way is the wikipedia page of the composer
